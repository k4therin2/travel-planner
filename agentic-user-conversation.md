[![Hacienda San Angel - Puerto Vallarta Luxury Boutique Hotel in MX](https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.EmI3osVIgQFwD77D7minHAHaLG?cb=ucfimg2\&pid=Api\&ucfimg=1)](https://haciendasanangel.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Using **$1 ≈ 18.0 MXN** for rough conversions. ([Wise][1])

## Core Plan (low-stress, high-certainty)

### Tonight (Fri 12/12) — arrival night, “white lotus” recovery mode

**Plan A: Dinner at your hotel — Hacienda San Angel Gourmet (rooftop)**

* **Why it matches your bar**

  * Beautiful, calm, zero logistics (you’ll be tired), and built for sunset-city views. ([Hacienda San Angel - Puerto Vallarta][2])
* **What to do/order**

  * Ask them *explicitly* to handle **seafood allergy / cross-contact**; stick to meat/veg mains.
  * Ask for a terrace table; follow dress code (they’re serious). ([OpenTable][3])
* **Cost (USD pp)**: usually **$60–$150** depending on wine/cocktails.
* **Crowd strategy**: go **8:00–8:30pm** (post-arrival, after the first seating).
* **Evidence notes**: official restaurant page + OpenTable description + consistent “view/romantic” positioning. ([Hacienda San Angel - Puerto Vallarta][2])

**Plan B (if you’re energized): The Iguana at Casa Kimberly (Elizabeth Taylor hideaway vibes)**

* **Why**

  * Open-air, view-heavy, “secret hideaway” energy; contemporary Mexican with “fresh, local, seasonal” stated intent. ([Casa Kimberly][4])
* **What to order**

  * Go à la carte (easier to avoid seafood than tasting).
* **Cost (USD pp)**: **$70–$160**.
* **Crowd strategy**: reserve for **~7:00pm** or **after 9:00pm**. ([OpenTable][5])

---

### Tomorrow (Sat 12/13) — calm morning + choose your “nature vs beach-service” track

#### 7:30–9:30am — **Town walk (before crowds)**

* Walk down toward **Malecón** early when it’s breezy and uncrowded; it gets busier later. (You’re positioned perfectly staying near Centro.)
* Optional: quick peek at the **Guadalupe Church / Gringo Gulch** neighborhood streets on the way.

#### Breakfast (pick one)

**Option 1: Coco’s Kitchen (classic PV brunch, real-deal execution)**

* Cred: long-standing, widely cited as a top brunch spot (NYT/Lonely Planet have both highlighted it historically). ([Wikipedia][6])
* **Crowd strategy**: arrive **right at open** or be ready to wait.

**Option 2 (quieter): A Page in the Sun (coffee + patio chill)**

* Low-chaos, good for easing into the day. ([Tripadvisor][7])

**Coffee stop:** **Puerto Café** for a proper espresso break. ([Tripadvisor][8])

---

## Midday choice: your vibe decides the day

### Track A — **Nature + payoff hike** (best “meaning per minute”)

**Boca de Tomatlán → Playa Las Ánimas coastal hike** (then water taxi back)

* **Why**

  * Legit scenic, athletic, not a packaged tour. AllTrails flags it as rough in parts—good for you, and it naturally filters out casual crowds. ([alltrails.com][9])
* **Practical**

  * Expect ~**2 hours one-way** with stops, limited bathrooms. ([PV Walking Adventure][10])
  * Do **hike out + water taxi back** to avoid doubling distance in midday heat.
* **Cost**

  * Mostly free; plan **$10–$25 pp** for water taxi depending on negotiation/route. ([Airial][11])
* **Crowd strategy**: start **early (9–10am)**.

### Track B — **Adults-leaning beach-service day** (lounger + drinks brought to you)

**Táu Beach Club (Casa Velas) day pass**

* **Why**

  * Purpose-built “daybed/concierge” relaxation; day passes exist. ([Casa Velas][12])
* **Cost reality check**

  * Pricing varies by source/time: one report says **~2,000 MXN** with credit included (≈ **$110**), while older materials cite lower pricing. Budget **$100–$150 pp** and confirm same-day. ([Velas Resorts][13])
* **Crowd strategy**: go **weekday if possible**, arrive at opening, reserve a Bali bed.

**Backup (in Zona Romántica): Sapphire Ocean Club**

* Works if you want something close and easy, but it’s on Los Muertos Beach (so: more people).
* Day-pass pricing varies by setup; assume **low entry + higher spend for the best loungers**. ([Venturists][14])

---

## Dinner tomorrow (Sat) — pick your “chef-y” lane

**1) Makal (Modern Mexican, Romantic Zone)**

* **Why**: contemporary Mexican (not “wrong place cuisine”), strong foodie fit. ([Makal Gastronomia][15])
* **Cost**: **$40–$120 pp** depending on drinks.

**2) Café des Artistes (big night, lush garden fine dining)**

* **Why**: long-running “special occasion” spot; menu shows serious technique and non-seafood mains exist. ([Café Des Artistes][16])
* **Allergy note**: they do serve lots of seafood—tell them clearly and don’t do the tasting unless they confirm a seafood-free version.
* **Cost**: **$90–$180 pp**.

**3) Tintoque (if you want a tasting-menu flex)**

* **Why**: consistently described as tasting-menu caliber with strong service + setting. ([Tripadvisor][17])
* **Allergy note**: higher risk because tasting menus often lean seafood—only do it if they confidently accommodate.
* **Cost**: tasting menu frequently cited around **~2,106 MXN (~$115) pp** before add-ons. ([Reddit][18])

---

## Nightcap with authentic music (not a staged “tourist show”)

**Garbo Piano Bar (intimate, music-first)**

* **Why**: small, live piano/jazz vibe; tends to feel more “neighborhood regulars” than spectacle. ([Tripadvisor][19])
* **Crowd strategy**: show up **early** for good seating.

**If you want cocktails instead:** **El Colibrí** (speakeasy-ish, reservation recommended) ([The Infatuation][20])

---

## Flex List (swap-in options)

### Beach club alternates

* **El Dorado**: classic beachfront chairs + service, but menu is seafood-forward (not ideal for you). ([eldoradopvr.com][21])
* **Casa Velas “daycation” via ResortPass**: adults-only property experience + access to Táu Beach Club is marketed. ([ResortPass][22])

### Food alternates

* **Sonorita Olas Altas** (when you want *actually good* tacos, not a line-trap): get the **al pastor**. ([Tripadvisor][23])
* **Le Kliff** (splurge for a dramatic cliffside setting): gorgeous, but the menu is “global/international” — go for views, not for purity of local cuisine. ([Lekliff][24])
* **Barrio Bistro (Versalles)**: more local neighborhood energy; mixed cuisine, so it’s a “quality-first” exception. ([barriobistro.mx][25])

### Experiences with real payoff

* **Cookin’ Vallarta** (high-rated cooking school option) ([Tripadvisor][26])
* **ChocoMuseo workshop** (easy, tasty, low-effort) ([Tripadvisor][27])
* **In-villa agave tasting** (tequila/mezcal/raicilla + chocolate pairings) ([vallartatequilatastings.com][28])

---

## Avoid List (PV-specific trap filter)

* **Majahuitas**: explicitly positioned as a DJ beach party (not your calm beach club). ([NexusTours][29])
* Any spot with: *huge menu + “authentic!!!” marketing + prime waterfront + inconsistent food photos* (classic PV tourist treadmill).
* **Seafood-centric beach clubs** if your allergy is cross-contact sensitive (kitchens on the beach often share fryers/grills).

---

## Two tiny prompt upgrades for your system (worth adding)

1. Add a hard rule: **“Seafood allergy = must provide a cross-contact plan, or it’s rejected.”**
2. Add a “pricing truth” rule: **if sources disagree on day-pass pricing, present a range + label which source is newest.**

If you tell me **how many full days you’re in PV** and whether you prefer **Track A (hike)** or **Track B (beach-service)** tomorrow, I’ll lock this into a clean day-by-day itinerary with reservation targets.

USER: I'd like to look into snorkel too. I would love a unique cooking class at a beautiful location. And anything else unique/high quality on Viator tour-wise, let me know. 


RESPONSE: 
[![Snorkeling Los Arcos | Puerto Vallarta Mexico — My Deztination](https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.49YrgowtDDYy7cgGk3VGXQHaEK?cb=ucfimg2\&pid=Api\&ucfimg=1)](https://www.mydeztination.com/new-blog/snorkellosarcos?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Here are the **highest-payoff, lowest-BS** Viator-style picks for **snorkel + a genuinely good cooking class + a few other “worth your time” experiences** in/near Puerto Vallarta.

## Snorkeling (pick based on how much you hate crowds)

### 1) **Private Los Arcos snorkel w/ marine biologist guide** (quiet-luxury version)

* **Why it matches your bar:** private boat (escape the herd), guide is a **marine biologist + certified lifeguard**, Los Arcos is the classic “good visibility + fish/rock arches” spot. ([Viator][1])
* **Price (USD):** **from ~$564 per group** (Viator listing). ([Viator][2])
* **Crowd strategy:** go **earliest slot**; Los Arcos gets busier mid-day.
* **Seafood allergy note:** tour includes snacks/soft drinks, not lunch by default—still tell them **no seafood on-board** to avoid cross-contamination. ([Viator][1])

### 2) **Marietas Islands snorkel + “Hidden Beach optional”** (high payoff, but rules-y)

* **Why it matches your bar:** the scenery is unreal, and this specific product is a common “Marietas + chance at Playa del Amor” format. ([Viator][3])
* **Price (USD):** **from $99** (base tour on Viator). ([Viator][3])
* **Reality check (important):** Hidden Beach access is **strictly regulated** (permits/conditions; not every day; not always possible). Official park info shows set schedules/fees for the area, and multiple sources note strict protection/limits. ([CONANP][4])
* **Crowd strategy:** if you care about Hidden Beach, book a tour that *explicitly* says access is included/guaranteed *and* verify permit handling before paying (conditions can still cancel access). ([Viator][5])

### 3) **Budget-but-still-solid alternative:** Los Arcos paddleboard + snorkel

* **Price (USD):** **from ~$62** on Viator listings. ([Viator][2])
* **Tradeoff:** you’ll be with more people; still fun, less “hideaway.”

**Operator message you can paste (snorkel):**
“Hi! We’re experienced swimmers but want a calm, uncrowded experience. Please confirm group size + boat size. One guest has a **seafood allergy**—please confirm no seafood handling/serving on board (or strict separation). We prefer the earliest start time for calmer water.”

---

## Cooking class (the one that actually sounds like your Naxos/Sintra-type memory)

### **Mexican Cooking Experience: Market, Tequila & Margaritas** (beautiful setting + “real day” feeling)

* **Why it matches your bar:** it’s positioned as **market → cook → tequila/margs**, and the listing/photos emphasize a **scenic, stay-awhile setting** (not a fluorescent “tour kitchen”). ([Viator][6])
* **Price (USD):** **from ~$91.87** ([Viator][6])
* **Crowd strategy:** book on a weekday; choose morning start if offered (market is better earlier).
* **Seafood allergy:** message them in advance to swap any seafood components (common in Vallarta classes).

If you want a **more chef-y/private feel**, also consider a **private market tour + cooking class at an internationally trained chef’s home** style option (verify the exact menu for seafood). ([Viator][7])

---

## Other “actually worth it” Viator picks (low-chaos, high-quality)

### **Vallarta Botanical Garden + tequila tasting (+ lunch)**

* **Why it matches your bar:** nature-forward, relaxed pace, non-clubby, and a good antidote to tourist-zone energy.
* **Price (USD):** **from $85** ([Viator][8])

### **Premium Finca 18 tequila tour + chocolate pairing**

* **Why it matches your bar:** focused, adult-leaning, and “producer + pairing” tends to filter out the rowdy crowd.
* **Price (USD):** around **$83–$85** depending on seller/date. ([expedia][9])

### **Bean-to-bar chocolate workshop (small-group)**

* **Why it matches your bar:** craft-focused, hands-on, and consistently reviewed.
* **Price (USD):** **from $62.90** ([Viator][10])

### **San Sebastián del Oeste day trip** (mountain air, coffee/history vibes)

* **Why it matches your bar:** “get out of PV” day that’s usually calmer and more textured than beach-club hopping.
* **Price (USD):** **from $85** on Viator’s San Sebastián listings. ([Viator][11])

---

## Quick “avoid” list for your taste profile

* **Big booze cruises / “party catamarans”** when you want snorkeling: tends to be loud + rushed + cafeteria lunch.
* **Anything that’s “Hidden Beach!!” without clear permit language** (or it’s buried in fine print). ([Journey Mexico][12])
* **Mega-menu “Mexican & Italian & Sushi” restaurants near the Malecón/cruise density zones** (usually the exact review-trap you described).

If you tell me **(1) how many days you’re in PV** and **(2) whether Hidden Beach is a must vs “nice if possible,”** I’ll snap these into a **low-stress itinerary with downtime** (and I’ll route it from Hacienda San Angel so you’re not zig-zagging).

## Weather for Puerto Vallarta, Mexico:

Current Conditions: Mostly sunny, 87°F (30°C)

Daily Forecast:

* Friday, December 12: Low: 65°F (18°C), High: 87°F (30°C), Description: Hazy and humid; air quality will be very unhealthy
* Saturday, December 13: Low: 63°F (17°C), High: 86°F (30°C), Description: Hazy and humid; air quality will be very unhealthy
* Sunday, December 14: Low: 66°F (19°C), High: 86°F (30°C), Description: Hazy and humid; air quality will be very unhealthy
* Monday, December 15: Low: 66°F (19°C), High: 86°F (30°C), Description: Humid with a blend of sunshine and clouds
* Tuesday, December 16: Low: 64°F (18°C), High: 86°F (30°C), Description: Humid with brilliant sunshine

You’ve got **Fri night + 3 full days + a departure day (Tue 7pm flight)**. Quick note: forecast is **hot/humid and hazy** the next few days —so I’m biasing toward **water / shaded / early-start** plans.

Using **$1 ≈ 18.0 MXN** for rough math. ([Wise][1])

## The 3 things worth booking ASAP

1. **Marietas snorkel + Hidden Beach (if you care about Hidden Beach)**

   * **Playa del Amor (Hidden Beach)** is officially **Wed–Sun** access (and the park has specific hours). ([CONANP][2])
   * Permits are limited; some Viator tours explicitly say it’s **not 100%** even if you book. ([Viator][3])
2. **Cooking class: “Market, Tequila & Margaritas”** (the “beautiful location” one) ([Viator][4])
3. **1–2 dinners** (Iguana / Makal / Tintoque), because weekend prime tables go fast. ([OpenTable][5])

---

# A low-chaos, high-payoff itinerary (Sat–Tue)

## Saturday (tomorrow): settle in + beach-service day

**Morning (cooler + calmer):** town stroll + coffee, then late breakfast.
**Midday–late afternoon:** **Táu Beach Club (Casa Velas) day pass** via ResortPass (easy logistics + loungers/service). Táu Beach Club hours are listed **10am–5pm** on ResortPass. ([ResortPass][6])

* Pricing floats (press releases have cited **$50 pp incl. $30 credit**, but confirm current pricing when you book). ([Casa Velas][7])

**Dinner:**

* **Makal** (contemporary Mexican). Their own menu is very seafood-forward in places, so just pre-flag **seafood allergy** and ask for the safest non-seafood path. ([MAKAL][8])

## Sunday: the “big water day” (best day for Hidden Beach attempt)

### Option A (most iconic): **Marietas Islands snorkel + Hidden Beach (attempt)**

* Viator has multiple Marietas tours; some claim a **high chance** of Hidden Beach, but it’s still permit/conditions dependent. ([Viator][9])
* Officially, **Playa del Amor is Wed–Sun** (so **Sunday is your last good shot** before Tuesday departure). ([CONANP][2])
* Pack: **rashguard + hat**; some operators/park rules discourage or prohibit sunscreen at Hidden Beach. ([Wildmex Surf School & Adventure Center][10])

**Dinner (post-boat, keep it romantic + easy):**

* **The Iguana (Casa Kimberly)** — contemporary Mexican, beautiful hillside setting. ([Casa Kimberly][11])

### Option B (quieter/cleaner): **Private Los Arcos snorkel with marine biologist**

* This is the “anti-herd” snorkel: private boat + marine biologist guide. ([Viator][12])

## Monday: cooking class day (beautiful location + real payoff)

**Midday:** **“Mexican Cooking Experience: Market, Tequila & Margaritas”**

* Viator reviews mention **breathtaking views**; list price shown **from $91.87** and it’s a longer, immersive format. ([Viator][4])
* Message them in advance: **seafood allergy + cross-contact** + “please avoid ceviche/seafood prep entirely.”

**Dinner:** keep it lighter after the big meal (or do a cocktail bar night).

## Tuesday (departure 7pm): jungle beauty, but make it low-risk for travel timing

**Best fit:** **Vallarta Botanical Garden via their own shuttle**

* The garden runs a **round-trip shuttle** departing **9:30am** from Old Town and returning **2:00pm** (ticket includes admission). ([vbgardens.org][13])
* Garden hours are **9am–6pm** in season. ([vbgardens.org][14])

**Food allergy note:** the on-site Hacienda de Oro menu includes seafood items, so you’ll want to order carefully and still flag the allergy. ([haciendadeoro.com][15])

**Airport buffer:** I’d target **arrive ~3 hours early** for an international flight if you want zero stress (2 hours is often fine at PVR, but holiday/weekend variability is real). ([TIME][16])

---

# “Viator-only” extra uniques that are actually worth your time

* **Premium Artisanal Tequila Tasting at El Tasting Room** (2 hours, **from $59**, very “adult craft” vibe). ([Viator][17])
* **Half-day Botanical Garden tour (4 hours, from $49.50)** if you’d rather not manage shuttle logistics yourself. ([Viator][18])
* **San Sebastián del Oeste** (coffee factory + distillery + cobblestone town) is a great high-meaning day, but it’s a **full-day** commitment—better for a non-flight day. ([Viator][19])

---

If you tell me **which snorkel you want** (Marietas vs Los Arcos vs “both”), I’ll tighten this into a booked-times version (with exact “leave hotel by” times + 2 backup options per day).

USER:

Shortlist:
- nice cooking class (pool)
- snorkel - preference for arc, or good fish scenes, but we're only 2 not a group.
- chocolate class

Note we have reservations at Le Kliff Monday night, and wedding Saturday afternoon/evening.

Can you check availability of these things and slot them in? I'd like the beach club to be Monday or Tuesday (avoid crowds)


AGENT: 
I can **slot these in**, but I **can’t truly “confirm live availability”** from here because Viator/ResortPass availability is inside interactive calendars that don’t expose inventory in the page text. What I *can* verify: these are **currently bookable listings**, with **defined durations/meeting points**, and (for chocolate) a **set start time (10:30am)** on the listing itself.

## Your slotted plan (Sat–Tue)

### Sat (wedding day)

**AM**: Keep it easy + local coffee walk (save your energy for wedding).
**Afternoon/evening**: Wedding.

### Sun (best “clean slate” day for water)

**Private snorkel (for 2): Los Arcos + (optionally) Colomitos — morning**

* This Viator listing is explicitly **private** (“only your group will participate”).
* Aim for **earlier start** for calmer water + fewer boats.

**Two quality tiers to choose from**

1. **Value private**: *Private Snorkeling Adventure: Los Arcos & Colomitos* (private; includes Los Arcos + Colomitos in itinerary; shows “From $49” on page—likely per-person, so confirm at checkout).
2. **Higher-certainty / “expert-leaning”**: *Private Los Arcos snorkeling* options on the Los Arcos page show **higher price points** (e.g., “Private Los Arcos snorkeling” from **$564.11**).

**Allergy note:** many snorkel tours include snacks/lunch; message the operator “**no seafood**” before confirming (and bring backup snacks).

### Mon (your “beautiful cooking class + pool” day) + Le Kliff night

**Mexican Cooking Experience: Market, Tequila & Margaritas (La Dulce Vista) — daytime**

* **5 hours**, includes a **pool swim** (multiple reviews mention the pool + “bring your bathing suit”).
* **From $91.87 per person** on the listing; meeting point is in **Marina Vallarta**.
* **Seafood allergy flag:** sample menu includes a jalapeño “filled with **shrimp or cheese**”—you’ll want to pre-request **cheese-only**.

**Buffer for Le Kliff:** treat the cooking class as your “one big daytime thing,” then **nap/reset** before dinner.

### Tue (your “chocolate + chill beach club + fly out” day)

**10:30am – ~12:30pm: Chocolate & Truffles Workshop (ChocoMuseo)**

* Viator listing shows **start time 10:30am**, small max group (**8 travelers**).
* If you’d rather book direct, ChocoMuseo’s own page also states **Mon–Sat 10:30am** and ~**2 hours** (but it doesn’t show price).

**1:00pm – ~3:45pm: Adults-leaning beach club day pass (low chaos)**
**Táu Beach Club via Casa Velas** is the cleanest “quiet luxury” fit I’m seeing:

* Casa Velas is described as **adults 18+** and includes access to Táu Beach Club.
* ResortPass lists Táu Beach Club hours **10:00am–5:00pm** (good for a half-day before the airport).
* Third-party listing shows Táu hours **10:00am–5:30pm**.

**Airport buffer:** leave the beach club around **4:00pm** to be comfortably on track for a **7:00pm** flight.

## “Availability-check” click path (fast)

1. Open each Viator listing and hit **Check Availability** (set **Dec 14** snorkel, **Dec 15** cooking, **Dec 16** chocolate).
2. If a time you want is missing, use the swap options below (same vibe, minimal replanning).
3. Message each operator immediately after booking: **seafood allergy**, and for snorkel: “**we’re 2 people + prefer quieter, less crowded spots**.”

## Swap options if something is sold out

* If **Mon cooking** is full → move it to **Sun afternoon**, and do snorkel **Mon morning**.
* If **Tue beach club pass** is limited → do beach club **Mon daytime** instead, and keep Tue as **chocolate + pack + airport**.

If you want, tell me what time your **Le Kliff** reservation is (e.g. 6:30 vs 8:30) and whether you prefer **“best value private snorkel”** or **“pay more for higher certainty”**—and I’ll tighten the timing to the hour.



USER: Can you provide links with each option? To the relevent listing you found previously. 

AGENT: Here are **direct links** (each has a **Check Availability / date picker** on the listing). Priority order matches your vibe + your schedule (snorkel **Sun**, cooking **Mon daytime** before Le Kliff, chocolate **Tue AM**, beach club **Mon or Tue**).
